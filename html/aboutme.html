        <h4>About Me</h4>

        <p>I am Nik Earl, a senior undergraduate student studying Software Development and Business at Brigham Young University. In my spare
            time, I like to tinker with computers and circuit boards, work on or drive my car, and play racing simulation video games. I also love
            spending time with friends and family. I am working on entering the workforce as a Software Developer in the near future when I graduate
            in April of 2025. My goal is to eventually work in the Automotive sector as a systems developer or user experience engineer, but we'll
            see where my career takes me in the meantime!
        </p>
