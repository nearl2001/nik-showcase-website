# IS 201 Personal Website

This is a website built using static HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It uses GitHub pages to host the site through my custom url nikolasearl.click. 
This website was mostly just to complete the IS 201 website project, but it was really fun to make. I am currently developing a new version of my 
personal website in [this Repository](https://github.com/nearl2001/personal-website) and will be migrating my custom url to this site once it's ready.
